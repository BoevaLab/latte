## Submitting an issue

If you find a bug, please submit [a new issue](https://github.com/BoevaLab/CanSig/issues).

To be able to reproduce a bug, we will usually need the following information:
  - Versions of Python packages used (in particular version of this library).
  - A minimal code snippet allowing us to reproduce the bug.
  - What is the desired behaviour in the reported case?
  - What is the actual behaviour?


## Submitting a Pull Request

Do:
  - Do consider submitting a draft pull request with a description of proposed changes, before starting actual work.
  - Do follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
  - Do write unit tests (``tests`` directory). We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org).
  - Do write [Google-style docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).

Don't:
  - Don't include license information. This project is MIT licensed and by submitting your pull request you implicitly and irrevocably agree to use this.
  - Don't implement too many ideas in a single pull request. Multiple features should be implemented in separate pull requests.
